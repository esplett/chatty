# Chatty App aka 'Pit Stop'
=====================

A client-side SPA (single-page app) built with ReactJS, Webpack, Babel, Node.js and Web Sockets. The client-side app communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates. No persistent database is involved; the focus is on the client-side experience.

My design concept was influenced by 'nihilist philosophy' and European philosopher Slavoj Zizek (using a watercolor painting I found of him online) to create an oppressive atmosphere while chatting with other users about the futility of existence in the 'pit' of despair.
